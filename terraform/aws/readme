These terraform scripts will create an ec2 instance, vpc security group and a key pair (generated locally) in aws. The ec2 instance will be set to use the key pair and the vpc security group. The security group will allow ssh traffic in.
The ec2 instance will also run a command using the "remote-exec" provisioner in order to touch a file in /tmp. The purpose of this is to ensure that the instance is up and running before running a "local-exec", which will eventually kick off an ansible playbook to configure the machine.



Points of interest for future reference:
The "vpc_security_group_ids" is dynamically allocated by using the resource attribute reference which in this case is "aws_security_group.stock-check-sec-group.id"

To connect to the instance with ssh use
sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws_id_rsa ec2-user@54.81.220.117 #sudo due to key permissions in wsl
